    Do you know the reason why WW1 started? It didn't just start with killing and shooting did it? Well, no. It had one reason that grew into big consequences.<br>A group called ''Black hand'' decided to assassinate Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria / Hungary. The first attempt<br> failed when a bomb was thrown to his and his wife's car. The conspirator was arrested. When the car carried on going on down an alternate route, <br>Gavrilo Princip, part of the black hand members, happened to be there. He shot Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie. <br>This became a crises and Austria declared war on Serbia and in response Russia declared war on Austria. Other <br>nations obliged by their alliances joined in, bringing the outbreak of the First World War.

    What was life like on the western front? </h3>
  <p>
    On the Western front... Now, what is the western front?<br>
  </p>
  <ul>
  <li>  The western front is a 400miles + stretch of land that goes through France and Belgium.<br> People who fought on the western front suffered brutally and more the those further ones. <br>The western front was the closest trench line to the enemies and so the bombs and guns<br> were directly pointed towards them. There were 3 trench lines. All the soldiers swapped around<br> them. This is how the life of the people on the western front was.<br></li>

<li>Boredom was a constant problem. Soldiers carried out their chores and tried to catch sleep<br>whenever they could. Soldiers of the front line were very far away from home<br> and wrote letters home to family and they recorded their life in poems and things like that. </li>
<li>Trenches were smelly and full of water. Standing in the water would give the soldiers a disease called trench foot. <br></li>

    <li>In the trenches, lice sat inside clothing and caused itchiness and trench fever.<br></li>

<li>Shell shock was a big problem. Because of all the loud sounds of shells and bombs, the soldiers got frequent trauma on the western front. </li>
<li>That is not the only problem as soldiers were scared that they would be killed with snipers and artillery.<br>ldiers carried out their chores and tried to catch sleep whenever they could. Soldiers of the front line were very far away<br> from home and wrote letters home to family and they recorded their life in poems and things like that. <br></li>

  <h1>Advancements in warfare that happened during WW1</h1>
  <h2> Chlorine Gas</h2>
 <p> Chlorine gas played a major role in WW1. A scientist called Fritz Harbor, experimented in things and made chlorine gas. In April 1915. he sent 150 tons<br> of this lethal gas to the German troops. The Germans used this to attack the French. First the French thought that it was just a smoke screen but it was<br> actually gas and it killed them slowly and painfully. But the weather really mattered as well because sometimes the Germans would throw the gas but<br> instead of going to the French, the wind would push towards them. To solve this problem they pushed the gas out through canons for it to travel further away.<br>Later The French and British found a way to get rid of this gas and made face masks out of cotton. They later made gas masks to protect them.</p>
  <h2>Guns</h2>
  <p>Guns played a major role in world war 1. It killed many people but have you thought about this? There was a time in the war when these guns were really rare and even those rare ones weren't as advanced as they were at the end of the war. In the beginning there were only guns that shot out one bullet at a time. But eventually they made guns that could shoot out around 20 at a time !
