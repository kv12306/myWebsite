    Elements that led to the start of WW1
  </h3>
  <p>
    Do you know the reason why WW1 started? It didn't just start with killing and shooting did it? Well, no. It had one reason that grew into big consequences.<br>A group called ''Black hand'' decided to assassinate Arch Duke Franz Ferdinand, heir to the throne of Austria / Hungary. The first attempt failed when a bomb was thrown to his and his wife's car. The conspirator was arrested. When the car carried on going on down an alternate route, Gavrilo Princip, part of the black hand members, happened to be there. He shot Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie. This became a crises and Austria declared war on Serbia and in response Russia declared war on Austria. Other nations obliged by their alliances joined in, bringing the outbreak of the First World War.
